**File_Reader** is a simple file utility written in C. The idea behind File_Reader is to provide a simple/intuitive way to load the contents of a file into memory. As such, the File_Reader utility does not provide much in the way of features at this moment. More features can and will likely be added to this utility as I experience the need for them.
