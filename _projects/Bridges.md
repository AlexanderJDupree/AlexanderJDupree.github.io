**LinkedListsCPP** project features a collection of linked list data structures. These linked lists are fully templated and mirror the syntax and functionality of the C++ standard library containers. Currently only the linear linked list is implemented, but stay tuned for doubly and circular linked list releases!

**Bridges** is an educational project to implement a Http/s server. This project is still in its very early stages of development.
