Built With: **Python**, **GitHub API**, **networkx**, **requests**, **circleci**

Skills Learned: **Pip Package Distribution**, **REST API Calls**, **HTTP Requests**, **Graph Visualizaion Tools**

The **GitHubNetwork** is a command line application that helps crawl and visualize your social network here on GitHub! GitHubNetwork utilizes the networkx library in conjunction with GitHub API calls to crawl your follower/following lists and generate a directed graph. This graph is nodes are positioned with according to a specified visualization method and saved to a .png file. The graph data is also saved in a separate file and can be reused with other visualization and analysis tools. This project was an educational exercise designed to expand my knowledge with such tools like networkx, matplotlib, pip, argparse, and the GitHub API. The orignal idea for this project came about during my networks and society class.
