## **whoami**

Given the bash command in the title it is safe to assume I am a command line nerd, technophile, and coding hobbyist. I am also a husband, father, and six-year Army veteran. I started programming in 2017 and it has been an extremely rewarding journey for me. This site is a way to communicate my passion for coding and lessons I have learned to anyone interested in my journey. 

Currently, I am finishing up my B.S. in Computer Science with a Minor in Mathematics at Portland State University. I am capable in C/C++, Java, and Python. My current focus is to finish my degree, but I am always open to new opportunities and challenges. 

When I'm not programming, I am reading, barbecuing, and spending time with my family.
